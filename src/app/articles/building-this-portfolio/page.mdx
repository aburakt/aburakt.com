When I decided to refresh aburakt.com, the goal was to translate my Ministry of
Interior work into a narrative that felt personal yet grounded in enterprise
results. Next.js gave me hybrid rendering out of the box, so the site performs
well whether youâ€™re browsing articles, scanning the projects page, or grabbing
my CV. Tailwind keeps the design system expressive without losing the visual
discipline I apply in government projects.

The build process doubled as a content audit. I rewrote every section from the
hero copy to the case studies, replacing placeholder text with real wins like
the authorization platform and analytics hub. Now, when I share the site with
stakeholders or recruiters, they can immediately see how my experience maps to
their needs.
