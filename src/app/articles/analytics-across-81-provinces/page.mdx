Early in 2025 we unified provincial reporting into a single analytics hub for
the Ministry of Interior. React, TanStack Query, and a hardened design system
let us deliver responsive dashboards that honor the same authentication model as
our other platforms while keeping role-based access straightforward.

We complemented those dashboards with a self-service workspace that standardizes
metrics and exports. Analysts can experiment without breaking governance rules,
and leadership can open a single screen to understand how policies are landing
across 81 provinces. The platform has become the connective tissue for
data-informed decisions everywhere we operate.
