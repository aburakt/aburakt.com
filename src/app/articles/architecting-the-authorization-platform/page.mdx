Throughout 2024 I led the rebuild of the Ministry of Interior’s authorization
platform, a system that shepherds every permission request across 81 provinces.
We replaced brittle legacy screens with a modular React and TypeScript
architecture so new directorates can reuse the same building blocks without
forking business logic.

Success depended on partnership. I mentored our four-person front-end team,
co-designed API contracts with Spring Boot engineers, and invested in automated
reviews that keep the codebase healthy. The payoff is a platform that processes
thousands of approvals each day while giving leadership real-time visibility into
what’s moving forward.
