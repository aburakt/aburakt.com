On the eve of launching this portfolio refresh I ran out of storage â€” again. To
stop babysitting Finder, I wrote the
[cleanup-macos-sysdata](https://github.com/aburakt/cleanup-macos-sysdata)
script, which sweeps Xcode caches, derived data, and orphaned Time Machine
snapshots while logging every action for review.

It leans on familiar shell tooling but adds dry-run mode, confirmation prompts,
and simple reporting so I can reclaim space with confidence before big builds or
recording demos. Keeping my development machine tidy now takes minutes instead of
hours.
