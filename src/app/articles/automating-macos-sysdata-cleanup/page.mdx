After running out of disk space one too many times, I wrote the
[cleanup-macos-sysdata](https://github.com/aburakt/cleanup-macos-sysdata)
utility to reclaim the mysterious “System Data” storage category. The script
systematically prunes Xcode caches, derived data, and orphaned Time Machine
snapshots, while logging every action so you can review changes before they’re
committed.

The project leans on familiar shell tooling—`tmutil`, `xcrun`, and `find`—but
wraps everything in safety rails like dry-run mode and explicit confirmations.
It’s become part of my monthly maintenance checklist, keeping my MacBook ready
for large React Native builds and ministry analytics datasets alike.
